% Data and code for results presented in "A computational model of 
% dopaminergic modulation of hippocampal Schaffer collateral-CA1 
% long-term plasticity" by Joseph Schmalz and Gautam Kumar
% 
%
% The Figure X files contain the data used to generate Figure X presented
% in the paper. Inorder to generate the figure run the matlab file "fig.m"  
% in the appropriate file.
% 
% The HFS and LFS models are provided in the files titled "HFS Model" 
% and "LFS Model", respectively. To run the model, open the main file in
% each folder (i.e. "main_HFS_model.m" for HFS model). The default settings
% for the HFS model generate date for Figure 1A and the default setting 
% for the LFS model generate simulation data for Figure 12A. In order to 
% generate simulation results for other figures change the parameters to 
% match those reported in paper. The parameters that will be changed are
% annotated in each main file.
